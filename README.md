## Lessons Learned

 - Angular Framework: I gained a deep understanding of the Angular framework and its concepts, such as components, modules, services, and routing. I learned how to build scalable and maintainable web applications using Angular.

- Ionic Framework: I acquired knowledge of the Ionic framework, which enabled me to develop mobile applications using web technologies. I learned about Ionic components, navigation, theming, and how to create a seamless user experience across multiple platforms.

- Mobile Development: Through this project, I gained experience in mobile app development. I learned about the unique challenges and considerations when building applications for mobile devices, including optimizing performance, handling different screen sizes, and integrating with native device features.

- Firebase: I explored the Firebase platform and its various services. I learned how to leverage Firebase Authentication for user authentication and Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I gained insights into integrating Firebase features like Cloud Messaging and Cloud Functions into my application.

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools

**Client:** Ionic, Angular

**Database:** Firebase

**Fake Store API Integration:**

This project integrates the Fake Store API as a mock data source for the e-commerce application. The Fake Store API provides a simulated environment with product data, allowing the application to fetch and display products without relying on a real e-commerce backend.

To interact with the Fake Store API, the application utilizes HTTP requests to retrieve product information, such as title, price, description, and images. The API endpoints are accessed using the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations like fetching products, adding items to the cart, and placing orders.

By integrating the Fake Store API, this application can demonstrate the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform while keeping the development process independent of a live production environment.

Please note that since the Fake Store API is a mock data source, any changes made within the application, such as adding items to the cart or placing orders, will not have real-world implications.

For more information on the Fake Store API, including the available endpoints and data structure, refer to the [Fake Store API documentation](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs).
